The Controls Configuration Database (CCDB) enables the collection, storage, and distribution of
(static) controls configuration data needed to install, commission and operate the European
Spallation Source (ESS) control system.

More specifically, the CCDB manages the information of thousands of (physical and logical) devices
such as cameras, PLCs, IOCs, racks, crates, etc…, that will be in operation at ESS by defining
their properties and relationships between these from the control system perspective.

This information is then consumed both by end-users and other ICS applications 
(e.g. Cable Database, IOC Factory, Csentry) to enable these to successfully perform their domain
specific businesses.
